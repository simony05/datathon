About our project


What is the problem or challenge that your project solves or addresses?

Our application aims to simplify the challenges faced by amateur winemakers in crafting exceptional red wine from home. Recognizing the significance of red wine quality, we acknowledge the disparity between low and high-quality wines, something that everyone can taste. Through a simplified range of features, our app allows winemakers to refine the variables to take account of, guiding them towards creating the finest quality wine.


How does your project work and what are its features?

Our project consists of four sliders, one for each feature that affects wine quality, with their bar graph representations that output the quality of wine based on the predicion equation produced by the wine dataset and Singlestore notebook. Our website also includes information on each of the four variables, explaining what it provides to the wine quality, and how to ensure the proper amount throughout the winemaking process. The user can learn about the main features that affect wine quality and test different combinations of the features to determine the quality of wine that will be produced.


What are the technologies or tools that you used to create your project?

To create the equation to predict the wine quality, we used the red wine quality dataset in a Singlestore notebook to run an analysis on the dataset and train multiple different machine learning models before selecting the best model, linear regression. To create the website, we used React and its many components, including sliders, bar graphs, and more. 


What are the benefits or impacts of your project for the users or the society?

Winemaking is a traditional process that usually occurs in professional vineyards, where recipes have been perfected over centuries of winemaking. The app will simplify the process for amateur winemakers with no experience in the exquisite field of winemaking, allowing them to easily create the best quality wine they can make form their homes.
